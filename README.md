# Agriculture-and-AI-Through-Reinforcement-Learning
In this paper, we propose a project to create a decision support system for farmers. The system predicts profitable crops in the near future, and integrates with irrigation systems to provide optimum water and fertilizer use. Using current literature, we identified viable parameters, artificial intelligence models, and limitations for such a system.
